# Huffman coding challenge

check out [the Kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/54cf7f926b85dcc4e2000d9d)

in this exercise, we'll expect a string of `0`s and `1`s, with each huffman code being seperated by a space.

For example, `aab baa` would be encoded as `1 1 01 00 01 1 1` (in this example `a == 1`, `  == 00` and `b == 01`
